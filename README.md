# Fust-Net
We develop a multilayer perceptron focused ultrasound temperature network (Fust-Net), which combines patient demographic characteristics, head indicators and treatment parameters to predict the treatment temperature of MRgFUS. The magnitude of the effect of 6 different predictors or combinations of predictors on the efficacy of Fust-Net for target temperature prediction was analyzed and tested. The contributions of each factor in the Fust-Net with best performance were calculated. Set1: Duration+Energy; Set2: Duration+Energy+SDR; Set3: Duration+Energy+SDR+Size; Set4: Duration+Energy+SDR+Size+Area; Set5: Duration+Energy+SDR+Size+Area+Course; Set6: Duration+Energy+SDR+Size+Area+Course+avp (Average power)+seqn(stimulus sequence number).
